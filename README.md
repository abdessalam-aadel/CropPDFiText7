CropPDFiText7 is a small programe that allow you can Crop Multiple PDF Files in different sub-folder in the same time,

i created a repository for the same concept [CropPDF](https://github.com/abdessalam-aadel/CropPDF/) but the tool I used (PDFTron) is becoming paid.

## Problematique
![problematique](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48380521/197403711-26b98b55-58b5-491e-81f6-3e323b508c16.png)

The problematique is to crop multiple pdf files in multiple sub-folder manualy,

each document contains two pages :

the first page as shown in the figure contains two pages (the first and the third)

that must be copied to new page (page 3),

and then all must be croping

 ## Solution
 View source code :)
 
 ![screen1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c241599a-6472-41b6-be7d-199a60a3d75c)

 primarily supports 64-bit architectures.

 iText 7 does not officially support 32-bit environments for .NET applications. This is due to the library's dependencies and the nature of modern PDF processing, which often requires the capabilities of 64-bit systems to handle large files and complex operations efficiently.
 
.Net Framework version : 8.0
